# Snake Game
You know the game.
## Description

This Python project is a simple Game of snake where players try to get the longest snake possible by eating apples randomly placed on the map.

## Instructions:

1. **Snake Movement:**
   - Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:
     - **Left Arrow:** Move the snake to the left.
     - **Right Arrow:** Move the snake to the right.
     - **Up Arrow:** Move the snake upwards.
     - **Down Arrow:** Move the snake downwards.

2. **Eat the Food:**
   - The goal is to eat the green food represented by a rectangle.
   - Each time the snake eats the food, its length increases.

3. **Avoid Collisions:**
   - Avoid colliding with the edges of the game window.
   - Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.

4. **Pause/Resume the Game:**
   - Press the **Spacebar** to pause or resume the game.
   - While paused, the snake's movement is halted, and the game is temporarily stopped.
   - Press the Spacebar again to resume the game.

5. **Quit the Game:**
   - Click the close button (X) on the game window to exit the game.

6. **Game Over:**
   - If the snake collides with the edges or itself, the game ends.
   - To play again, you can restart the script.
